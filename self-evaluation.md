# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
I would say im at about a 3 out of 5. I need to get better at remembering what variable to reference.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
Today was definitely more challenging but I had a mostly productive struggle today didn't get to hung up on one thing for too long and it was very rewarding when I figured a solution out.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I need to practice gettinf used to switching between the variable and one you make between the || it had me lost sometimes.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
no questions.
